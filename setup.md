# Connect to (and populate) your FHIR server to the Applications

The data from the applications are being served from a FHIR Server. You can easily deploy a managed FHIR server on Azure via the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-quickstart) or you can deploy the [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server) FHIR version. 

If you want to load dummy data into the FHIR server, you can use [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) to generate synthetic patient information. Where you then can import this data into your FHIR server via the open-source [FHIR loader](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-loader)
